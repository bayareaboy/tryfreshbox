                  You tell us how often you want it. Most of our customers are

                  than actual product. Unless you are into fancy packaging and
                  half fresh produce, we don't see why you shouldn't buy from
                  us.

                  There isn't one. Seriously. We minimize our costs by using
                  little to no packaging, cut middlemen between you and farmers
                  and use amazing technology.
